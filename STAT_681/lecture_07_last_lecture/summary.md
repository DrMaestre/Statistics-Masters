Title:  Last Lecture
Speaker: Emanuel Parzen, TAMU

Dr. Parzen presented an overview of what he considered fundamental statistics and important concepts from his personal point of view.  He focused heavily on the usage of the quantile function by both frequentists and bayesians and showed how in some cases Bayesian and Frequentists methods arrive at the same answer. He also spent time discussing the field of statistics. He proposed that all fields of research and applied sciences are using statistical methods and that statisticians have a responsibility to lead the way in statistical development. It seems to me that an example of this is the trend of analytics in business and now many schools offer degrees in analytics which seems to have a lot in common with statistics although it seems clear to me that the depth of understanding statistical methods is what sets to two degree paths apart. Maybe thats my own bias. I think Parzen's lecture was a draft of a paper he was writing. I believe I found this link to his finished paper if anyone would like it for there archives. http://www.stat.tamu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/parzen_zack.pdf
