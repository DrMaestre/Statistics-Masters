Topic:  Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART)
Speaker: Ed George, University of Pennsylvania

This was an interesting presentation by Ed George on Bayesian Additive Regression Trees. He compared BART's performance to other popular algorithms under many different scenarios and showed how BART had superior performance when compared to neural networks, gradient boosting, and random forests. I was very impressed with the algorithms ability to detect noise with so many variables on relatively few observations. It seems like it might have good applications in signal detection. I really enjoyed this lecture.
