Title: Least Angle Regression
Speaker: Tim Hesterberg

Hesterberg opened by talking about some of the releated penalized regression techniques including Ridge regression and LASSO and non-penalized regression including stepwise and stagewise regression. Least Angle regression has similarities to both regression methods in that it starts off similar to stepwise with using one predictor and continues to use that predictor until another predictor is more correlated with y, then it switches to the other predictor and starts increasing the coefficient. The main difference between stepwise and LAR is that stepwise considers multiple predictors at once, for a series of 4 iterations it may increase the coefficients in the following order: B1, B1, B2, B1, where LAR will switch entirely: B1, B1, B2, B2. As a result LAR tends to be much faster than stepwise and LASSO. Hesterberg also touched on statistical software and the need for good implementations of statistical ideas in software to promote usage.
