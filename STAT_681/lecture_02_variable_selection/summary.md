Topic:  Variable Selection
Speaker: Ed George, University of Pennsylvania

Ed George discussed different methods of variable selection by making it a model selection problem and discussed the pros and cons of various popular criteria. He talked about the differences between AIC and BIC, and the RIC criterion that he developed. He focused on adaptive penalties that change based on the data size and number of parameters being used.  I found the simulation slide interesting where the more common criteria were straight line linear functions of the number of parameters and loss, but the adaptive criteria methods had more logarithmic shaped curved and appeared superior to methods like AIC and BIC for models with many parameters. A good application for the adaptive criteria might be models dealing with genomes where there could potential be 1000s of parameters. I thought the lecture was interesting overall and I made me interested in learning some of the Bayesian methods which I have not been introduced to yet.
