### **Messy Experimental Designs**
**Professor Dallas Johnson**  
**Kansas State University**

#### Overview
An interesting lecture looking at experimental designs and some of their problems. Johnson discussed various items to consider when designing an experiment and a few approaches he used for some fairly complicated designs. I think it would have been beneficial to take a deeper look at one of the more complicated designs rather than the quick overview of many. The most interesting part of this lecture to me was the process of getting a messy/bad design and creating a better and more valid design from it. I would have liked to understand the strategy behind doing this. Johnson touched on this briefly, but I think that by itself is probably worth an entire lecture.

##### Experiment for studying the effects of baking temperatures on bread quality:
  * Johnson points out the many ways the experiment could be conducted and makes a point to consider the efficiency of the design
  * He also points out that almost any experiment can be analyzed under almost any design so it is very important to be able to detect where there may be problems in the analysis phase to prevent wasting resources when carrying out the experiment

##### Experiment for measuring Green bugs on multiple varieties of sorghum:
  * Pointed out that the initial design by the researcher would not be powerful enough to detect differences in varieties. He suggested an alternative design that added many more degrees of freedom to the variety comparison
  * Johnson uses this example to point out that it is important to consider the effects you want to measure when building the design of an experiment because you may end up with little data in which to to analyze or with effects that are confounded

##### Experiment for studying the differences in chemical treatments on several factors within growth chambers
  * The main problem with the design was that the layout of the treatments was done out of convenience and so was not randomized.

##### Experiment to compare the effects of 5 diets on small dogs
  * There were 5 cages with 10 dogs each and each cage was given a different diet. The problem with this design is that the cage is the experimental unit, not the dogs.
  * Another problem with this design is that the measurements recorded were not random, they were always on the same day and on different days for each cage.

##### Experiment to study herbicide treatments, wheat varieties, and nitrogen levels
  * This was a complex design because there are 5 different types of experimental units from 3 factors. Johnson showed how to maximize the degrees of freedom in the experiment.

##### Experiment to determine the effects of protein and energy levels on lambs
  * Johnson presented a case where some effects were partially confounded with each other

##### Experiment to compare treatments on pigs
  * A complicated experiment with many blocks and reps, with measurements taken over time.
