Title:  Modeling longitudinal data with excess zeros and measurement error: application to evaluating relationships between episodically consumed foods and health outcomes
Speaker: Victor Kipnis, NCI

Kipnis outlined a study for modeling the intake of food by individuals based on various methods of surveys. He compared the popular 24 hour recall method, where an individual reports from memory everything he consumed in the last 24 hours, to the FFQ method very and individual tries to summarise everything he ate over the course of the year. Kipnis shows how the 24 recall method has more bias than FFQ. One of his results shows significantly different coefficient estimates when building models from the two data collection methods. The FFQ method used the average response from individuals and had a significantly smaller RMSE due to being unbiased. The FFQ method allows for modeling data when traditional regression assumptions are violated, such as correlation between variables and highly skewed reponse distribution. I agree with other posts that i wish the lecture were longer. I would have liked to understand more of the statistical work that supported the studies.
