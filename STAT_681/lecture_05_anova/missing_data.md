Title: Analysis of Fixed Effects ANOVA Models with Missing Cells
Speaker: Michael Kutner, Emory University

Dr. Kutner walks through a few examples of handling missing data in simple fixed factor experiments. He points out that statistical packages may not be relied upon completely when you have missing data and that in most cases there is not a generic correct approach so each situation needs to be addressed individually. It is vital to make sure SAS is testing the correct Null hypothesis and with the correct degrees of freedom. The user of any statistical package should be aware of exactly what is being tested by default and a suggested approach to analyzing mssing data is to used custom contrasts.
