Problem A) If a parent has genotype Aa, he transmits either gene A or gene a to an offspring
(each with probability 1/2). The gene he transmits to one offspring is independent of the
one he transmits to another. Consider a parent with three children and the following events:
B=children 1 and 2 have the same gene
C=children 2 and 3 have the same gene
D=children 1 and 3 have the same gene
Show that all these events are pairwise independent, but not mutually independent.

Problem B, 1.5.22)
