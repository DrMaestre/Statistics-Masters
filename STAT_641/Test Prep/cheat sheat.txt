Follows an exponential distribution with mean m years. Suppose that 5 such batteries are randomly chosen, and their lifetimes are recorded as X1, · · · ,X5. The sample average and sample variance of these 5 observations are denoted by ¯X and S2. Answer the next four questions.

1. Find the probability that a randomly chosen battery will not survive more than 3 years? Assume that m = 7.2.

    Here lifetime X » Exponential such that mean is 7.2, therefore, f(x) = 7.2 exp(−x/7.2).
    pr(will not survive more than 3 years) = pr(X · 3) = 1 − exp(−3/7.2) = 0.3407. pexp(3, 1/7.2)

2. What is the distribution of the average lifetime of these 5 batteries? Use m = 7.2. Due to additive property \sum i=1 Xi will follow Gamma(5, 7.2). The average \sum i=1 Xi/5 will follow Gamma(5, 7.2/5).

4. Suppose that ¯X = 6.6 years. A 95% confidence interval for m is
    2*n*6.6/qchisq(0.025, 2*n)   [1] 20.32663 chisquared n*s
    > 2*n*6.6/qchisq(0.975, 2*n) [1] 3.222156

5. Suppose that we know 0 · p · 0.15. Find n such that we are 99% confident that bp is within 0.01 units of p (use Wald’s formula, and choose the best possible answer).

    Z®/2p(1 − p)/d2: qnorm(0.005)^2*0.15*(1-0.15)/0.01^2

In an extrasensory perception expreiment (ESP), five choices were offered for each question. Assume that a person without ESP gusses and thus correctly answers with probability (1/5). Assume that responses are independent from question to question, and altogether 100 questions were asked. Answer the next two questions.

6. What are the mean and standard deviation of the proportion of correct answers?
    E(ˆp) = p = 1/5 = 0.2 and var(ˆp) = p(1 p − p)/n = 0.2(1 − 0.2)/100. So, the standard error is 0.2 × 0.8/100 = 0.04.

7. What is the probability that a person without ESP will correctly answer at least 30 questions out of 100 questions (use normal approximation, and use 1 − pr(X · 29)).

8. Suppose that Y1, · · · , Y10 are iid observations from a normal distribution. The prediction interval for a future observation will be: \bar{Y} ± t_{\alpha/2, n−1} S \sqrt{1 + 1/n}, confidence interval no (1+)

Suppose that for testing H0: \mu = 2 vs Ha : \mu > 2 for a normal population with . = 1, 16 observations are drawn at random. Assume that the rule is that we reject H0 when \bar{X} > 2.5. Answer the next three questions.

9. What is the probability of Type-I error?
    pr(type-I error) = pr(Reject H0|μ = 2) = pr(\bar{X} > 2.5|μ = 2). Note that when μ = 2, \bar{X} ~ Normal(2, 1/16). Thus pr(\bar{X} > 2.5|μ = 2) = 1 − \iota{Z} = 0.0227.  Z = \sqrt(n) (\bar{x} - H_0)/sd (1 - pnorm(z))

10. What is the probability of Type-II error when μ = 2.5?
    pr(type-II error) = pr(fail to reject H0|μ = 2.5) = pr(\bar{X} < 2.5|μ = 2.5) = \iota{(2.5 − 2.5) × 4} = \iota(0) = 0.5.

11. Suppose the observed value of \bar{X} = 2.45. What is the p-value of the test?
    p-value= pr(\bar{X} > 2.45|H0 is true) = pr(\bar{X} > 2.45|μ = 2) = 1 − \iota{(2.45 − 2) × 4} = 0.0359.

12. What sample size is necessary if we want to reject H0 : μ = 2 against Ha : μ > 2 with 80% probability when μ = 2.2 along with probability of type-I error 0.01? Use \sigma = 1.
    pwr.norm.test(h = diff, sig.level = .01, power = .8, alternative = "greater")

13. Which of the following statements is correct regarding bootstrap precedure?
    The simulation error is controlled by the number of bootstrap samples B.

14. Which of the following statements is correct regarding hypothesis testing?
    Rejecting H0 when in fact H0 is true is the type-I error.

15. Suppose that for testing H0 : μ = 5 versus Ha : μ > 5 of a symmetric population that has heavy tails, 16 observations are drawn at random, and we reject H0 if 4(\bar{X} − 5)/S > t_0.05,15. Which of the following statements is most likely to hold?
    Probability of type-I error is likely to smaller than 0.05.

16. Suppose n observations are drawn at random from a population with unknown mean μ, variance \sigma^2, and corr(X_i,X_j) = p E (0, 1) for i \ne j. Which of the following statements is correct?
    SE(\bar{X} ) is underestimated by S / \sqrt{n}

Suppose that Y1, · · · , Y10 are drawn from a population. Using sign test we reject H0 : ˜μ = 2 against ˜μ > 2 when S^+ > k with a level of significance 0.05. Answer the next two questions.

17. Find the value of k.
    Under H0 S+ ~ Binomial(10, 0.5). 1 - pbinom(7, 10, .5) = .054, 1 - pbinom(8, 10, .5) = .01, k = 8

18. For the time being assume that k = 8 (this may not be the correct value of k). What is the power of the test when ˜μ = 2.2? Assume that pr(Y > 2.2) = 0.5 and pr(Y > 2) = 0.56.
    Note that here k is given to you. power= pr(Reject H0|Ha holds) = pr(S+ > 8|˜μ = 2.2).
    1 - pbinom(2.2, 10, .56)

19. Suppose that X1, · · · ,Xn are iid observations from a Normal(1, sigma^2) distribution. Which of the following statistics is a pivot? (i.e., its distribution is free from \sigma^2).
    T1 = (X1 −X2) ~ N(0, 2\sigma^2) and T2 = (X3 −X4) ~ N(0, 2\sigma^2), and they are independent. Also, T1/ \sqrt{2} \sigma ~ N(0, 1) and T2/ \sqrt{2} \sigma ~ N(0, 1). Note that T1/T2 = (T1/ \sqrt{2} \sigma)/(T2/ \sqrt{2} \sigma). Thus it is the ratio of two normal(0, 1) random variables, hence it is free from \sigma.

    (45/95)/(1 - (45/95)) = odds1, (400/100)/(1 - (400/1100)) = odds2, oddsRatio = odds1/odds2

    select the estimator with the smallest average squared distance from the parameter (smallest MSE)

18. The Anderson-Darling (AD) GOF statistic is prefered to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) GOF statistic for testing the goodness-of-fit of a continuous pdf because

In 100 one acre plots of land, the genetically engineered variety of broccoli was raised and the annual broccoli yields were recorded: B1, B2, . . . , B100. From USDA records, the broccoli yields per acre of 103,259 farms were recorded: Y1, Y2, . . . , Y103259. The sample means ¯B and ¯ Y are computed from the two samples.

24. A kinesiology researcher is studying the stress placed on older (50-70 years) long distance runners. In order to diagnosis potential problems in this group of runners, it is necessary to establish a range of values for their resting pulse rate such that with a very high degree of confidence this range would contain 95% of the resting pulse rates for this group of runners.
    The computed interval would be a tolerance interval.

25. A large corporation is evaluating two different suppliers of a raw material. The corporation’s engineers obtain a random sample of 20 units from each of the suppliers and determine a crucial product characteristic from the samples: X1, . . . ,X20 and Y1, . . . , Y20. Let ˜μ1 and ˜μ2 be the median for each supplier’s product characteristic. It is desired to test Ho : ˜μ1 = ˜μ2 versus H1 : ˜μ1 6= ˜μ2. An evaluation of the two data sets reveals the following:
    • The width of the box in the box plot for supplier 1 is much wider than the width for supplier 2.
    • The normal reference plots have the data values very close to a straight line for both data sets.
    • The two data sets are independent.
The preferred test statistic is
(a) Wilcoxon Rank Sum test
(b) Wilcoxon signed rank test
(c) Pooled t-test
(d) Separate variance t-test •
(e) Sign test

Statistical tests and estimators:
    - Wilcoxon Rank sum: comparing two related samples, matched samples, or repeated measurements on a single sample to assess whether their population mean ranks differ, allows for different sample sizes
    - Wilcoxon Sign rank: used for matched pairs
    - Pooled t-test: equal sample size, equal variance
    - Sign Test: difference in the median is 0, paired, not as powerful as wilcoxon or paired t-test
    - Anderson Darling GOF: test to see if a sample is from a specific distribution
    - KS GOF: same as AD, not a good in the tails
    - Mantel-Haenszel: estimate of association
    - Pearson Chisquared Test: applied to categorical data for liklihood that differences happened by chance, good with unpaired, large datasets
    - Breslow test: test for homogeneity of odds ratios
    - T-test: test differences in means
    - Mcnemars Test: paired nominal data, 2x2 contingency tables, matched pairs to test row/column marginal frequencies
    - Paired T-test: normal dist, difference in stdev unknown
    - Agresti-Coull CI: binomial confidence interval
    - Fishers Exact Test: used with small sample sizes on contingency 2x2 tables, hypergeometric dist
    - Shapiro Wilks: tests for normality
