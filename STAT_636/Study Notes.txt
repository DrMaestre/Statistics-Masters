Review for final
-------------------------------------

- Topic 6: Inferences about multiple means
	- HW5:
		- Recognize if data is paired or not. Be able to match the correct test with the data
		-	Given test statistics, compute p-value or confidence interval
	- Know the correct T2 test based on sample size, normality, and equal covariance
	- MANOVA table (one factor)
		-	Know we assume equal covariance
		- Know the different components of manova
			Treatment B (between), Residual W (within) (pooled covariance), B+W Total
		-  Assumptions (Multivariate Normal, iid, constant covariance)
	- Two way MANOVA (multiple factors)
	 	- Know what it is
		- What kind of a problem would you apply two way manova
		- How is it different than one way
		- Assumptions (Multivariate Normal, iid, constant covariance)


- Topic 7: Principle Components
	-	What is a principal component? (linear combination of the original variables)
		-	Each principal component is uncorrelated with the others
		- The first principal component represents the most variation in the data
		- Variance of principal components = eigen values
		- Make sure you understand what principal components is doing
	- Slide 23: Interpret the results from a principal component table
		- Weighted differences (+/-) Highlights individuals for which differences are extreme
		- all signs +/- means its a weighted combination
	- Scree Plot: How many components do you need and why?
	- Scatterplot of the principle components


- Topic 8: Clustering
	- Hierarchical Clustering (slide 19)
		- Dendrograms constructed by distance
			- Interpret diagram
			- Linkage: Single (closest), Complete (farthest), Avg
		- Different types of distance computations
	- KMeans: Talk through an example
		- Be able to list the steps
	- Multidimensional Scaling
		- Reorders data to try to preserve the data in fewer dimensions
	Biplot: Plot of principal components with annotations
		- Errors show the contribution of each variables


- Topic 9: Classification and Prediction
	- Basic Test vs Training Sets
